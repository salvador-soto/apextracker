Thanks for checking out my repo, this was a project I did to help learn JS and some frameworks. 
I noticed the code is all fucked and only has 2 lines for some files and a lot of code is in one line, I do not know how to fix that :/ this is my first repo on github.
Also another thing, DISCLAIMER: I did not make this entirely by myself. I followed a traversy media tutorial for some of the code, But I made it mine by doing a custom front end.
What is this project for? To search for an Apex gamer tag and display statistical info using tracker.gg API.
